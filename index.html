            <h1>General Class information</h1>
            <p>All adult and youth classes take place at Ballet Co. Laboratory (276 E Lafayette Frontage Road,
                Saint Paul, MN 55107).
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in affordable dance education, so additional uniforms/costumes or supplies are not
                needed. All dancers should wear close fitting apparel such as leggings/yoga pants/shorts or slim
                fit items and non-baggy tops (this allows students to see their body lines to learn better and
                keeps them safe while dancing). Students should also plan to be bare footed, however if shoes
                are desired due to feet sensitivity or for extra support, please reach out to me and I can
                recommend a couple cost effective options and where to get them. Please also bring a full
                water bottle.

            <p>Hi, I’m Bethany, and I am so glad you are here!</p>
            <p>I live in Roseville with my husband and our dog
                Piper, who is a husky and golden retriever mix. By day I work at a church in White Bear Lake as
                a youth director for kids ages 3-18 and in the evening, I like to be involved with dance or
                theatre, hang with friends, go on an adventure or enjoy a night in.</p>
            <p>I have trained in modern,
                contemporary, jazz, tap, musical theatre, and hip hop dance styles not only as an adolescent,
                but also in my adult career at Moorhead State University, Concordia University and Zenon
                Dance. During my time at Concordia, I was encouraged to take a choreography class by my
                dance professor, and it opened a whole new world to me of creating and teaching. I have had 8
                original choreographed pieces produced and have also choreographed for a couple children’s
                theaters in the Twin Cities area.</p>
            <p>The instruction and care shown to me by my dance teachers
                has shaped part of who I am today, kept my love for dance strong and has shown me what
                sharing your passion with students looks like. My style of teaching is rooted in a solid
                foundation of dance basics, as that is where all movement begins. However, it is not where it
                stops, and so I share with students that there is an endless world of possibilities when it comes
                to movement.</p>
            <p>Students learn not only the core basics that will shape them into a well
                experienced dancer, but that dance is truly an expression of story, experience and often what
                cannot be put into words. Beyond that, I have a passion for showing every person that I meet
                that they are loved, valued and important, and that shapes the way I teach as well. I hope to
                meet you soon! (P.S. if you would like a copy of my background check, feel free to email me and
